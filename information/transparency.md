# Event Activity That Is Stored
Guild Name, Deleted Messages (Includes the content this does NOT support bulk deletion i.e using a purge command), Edited Messages (includes the content), guildUpdates (Only contains the newName the old name is NOT stored unless previously logged in a log file)

# How is Event Activity used and what is it?
Event Activity is simply just console.log activity and simply put it's just the log of what is happening. We frequently backup this activity into a log.txt file which is stored locally. We use this to provide you support (i.e an event didn't log or threw an error, if you give us the time, we can go back and check it out, and fix it and provide you an answer) we do not do anything else with that log.txt file and only three people have access to the machine where it is located.


# A Notice on cached messages
Currently Log It does not cache old messages, however for the sake of providing the service `Log It` caching these messages may occur in the future, and please do note we will provide **extended warnings** before we make any changes like this. We care about privacy!

## Have a question, need support, or anything else regarding `Log It`?
use `/help` and join our Support Server and then create a `DiscordBot Support` ticket
