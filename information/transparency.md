# Event Activity That Is Stored
Guild Name, Deleted Messages (Includes the content this does NOT support bulk deletion i.e using a purge command), Edited Messages (includes the content), guildUpdates (Only contains the newName the old name is NOT stored unless previously logged in a log file), emoji updates, etc (most events that are recorded will end up having data stored in log.txt we do NOT sell this data and nor do we do anything with it. We only use the data to help find issues if they are reported or found during a log check)

# How is Event Activity used and what is it?
Event Activity is simply just console.log activity and simply put it's just the log of what is happening. We frequently backup this activity into a log.txt file which is stored locally. We use this to provide you support (i.e an event didn't log or threw an error, if you give us the time, we can go back and check it out, and fix it and provide you an answer) we do not do anything else with that log.txt file and only three people have access to the machine where it is located.

# A Notice on cached messages
Currently Log It does not cache old messages (NOTE: For the Guilded Version of Log It some things are auto cached. If something is not you will most likely see the response as null, unknown, or empty. If you extensively see these even after knowing the bot provided an update get in touch with us), however for the sake of providing the service `Log It` caching these messages may occur in the future, and please do note we will provide **extended warnings** before we make any changes like this. We care about privacy!
